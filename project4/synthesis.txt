1. For all the result from Seriable and repeatable read are always 1, 
while most of data from read commit are larger than the data from read uncommit slightly

Reason:
    1. Since Serializable is strictest among the four. Serializable prevent the Dirty Read, Nonrepeatable Read and Phantom Read. 
    2. Repeatable Read can prevent Dirty Read, Nonrepeatable Read

2. when S increase, the mean and variance are decreasing. 
Since when S increase, the probability to write the same line is increasing, So it is more possible to calculate wrong result using sum.

1. the uncommited and commited execution time are relative similiar. 
Compared to them,  most of time, the Repeatable read and Serializable are larger. 

Since the isolation level defines 4 level of transaction isolation. Te order is ReadUnCommit, ReadCommit, Repeatable Read, Serializable. 
So, the execution of Seriable should be largest accordingly. 

2. Most of time, time is increasing when S increase, but maybe since there is a lot of programming running at the same time, when I running python project. 
So the increase is not so significant.

1. The repeatable read and Serializable are always 1, mostly, the read uncommit is smallest and the variance is largest. 

Reason:
1. Since Serializable is strictest among the four. Serializable prevent the Dirty Read, Nonrepeatable Read and Phantom Read. 
2. Repeatable Read can prevent Dirty Read, Nonrepeatable Read
3. ReadCommit can prevent Dirty Read
4. ReadUnCommit do not prevent anything. 

So we can see the ReadUnCommit has least correctness

2. Compared to ReadCommit, ReadUnCommit is slightly smaller. 
Since ReadCommit can prevent Dirty Read. So in this case, dirty read is not much.

1. We found that when P = 70, 80, 90, the time is slightly larger. 

Reason:

1. Maybe the available resource is varying when I run the programme. Since there is something else running in my computer, these tasks may affect the result. 
2. As the number of subprocess increases, it may speed up subprocess increases. In the other hand, when subprocess increases, it is more probability to update one cell
by difference subprocess, which can trigger lock in database. The time will increase. 

2. ReadCommit and ReadUnCommit is smaller than Repeatable Read and Serializable. Specifically, Serializable is using more time than Repeatable Read. 

Reason:
1. The isolation level defines 4 level transaction isolation. The strictest order is ReadUnCommit, ReadCommit, Repeatable Read, Serializable. 
So Serializable is using most time since it is strictest.
